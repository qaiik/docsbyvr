# the Betastar docs
Welcome to our docs!

## You probably opened this file if you can code.
Betastar has vast libraries full of free information on the site. By reading these, you can glimpse a lot.

We're sharing the contents of these libraries here.

## Not a Tutorial
I'm not going to write a full tutorial on how to write docs, or find things in the code.

If you're a dev, you know this.

## The Point of this File
It's to tell you how to get your changes to our repository.

If they're spelling ones, not accepting them.

Since Pull Requests are confusing, [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) is a great tutorial.

## WAIT...
Yup, it took 24 lines to paste a link.

Have a great day!
